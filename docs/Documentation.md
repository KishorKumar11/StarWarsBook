May the force be with you ‚ö´ü§ñ‚öîÔ∏è

## Problems Encountered

## Learnings
- Customisable format settings
1. In the settings.json, add the necessary editor settings (formatOnSave, formatOnPsater etc...) and link it to prettier-vscode
2. Create a .prettierrc file and add in your desired code formatting (tabs, width, comma, bracket spacing etc...)

## Future Plans
- Replace 'Add to favorites' button with star icon to enable better user interaction
- Improve table display UI that matches the Star Wars theme
- Replace character detail preview modal with pages that include better UI for each character along with their pictures
- Improve UI of 'Favorites Only' and 'Clear Selection' button
- Add sliding transition between pages to simulate the "Force" as per the Star Wars theme
